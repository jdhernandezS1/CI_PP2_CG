Was searched for a friendly font and came upon ROBOTO from GOOGLE, which has been utilized in smartphones.

<br>

### __Structure__

Following the principles of UXD (user experience design), the page's structure was made to be fluid and simple to read. To determine the sort of design used in contemporary food pages, research was conducted at the most well-liked Classic games.
the following hues associated with the theme (Classic Car game)

The website was composed of five pages: 

- The home page, which includes the primary article, contact information, and social media links.
- Game page where the interactive platform that interacts with the main page is located and where the level and vehicle are chosen.
- The game's instructions page, which enables visitors to play, sadly does not work for blind persons.
- A 404 page, which is created for every broken link, prompts the user to rewrite the page.
- The page with the active form is called "Contact Us," and it provides information to us via email so we may read reviews and make improvements to the website.
