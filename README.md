The website was composed of five pages: 

- The home page, which includes the primary article, contact information, and social media links.
- Game page where the interactive platform that interacts with the main page is located and where the level and vehicle are chosen.
- The game's instructions page, which enables visitors to play, sadly does not work for blind persons.
- A 404 page, which is created for every broken link, prompts the user to rewrite the page.
- The page with the active form is called "Contact Us," and it provides information to us via email so we may read reviews and make improvements to the website.
